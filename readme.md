# ES 6/TypeScript Experiments

[My team at NXTbook Media](http://www.nxtbookmedia.com/) is considering
Angular 2 and TypeScript as a platform for future projects.

Therefore, I'm doing some small exercises to get a feel for TypeScript and ES 6
as languages.

This project is just to give me a place to keep them, along with notes on what
I'm learning and how I'm feeling about the two languages.

I care deeply about readability, simplicity, immediacy, and tooling in a
language. As an Emacser, I have a soft spot for Lisp (which is where the love
for immediacy comes from [even if the readability isn't so great]).

This project will likely wind up containing a hodgepodge of simple exercises,
along with notes on my experiences/reading/research thus far.
